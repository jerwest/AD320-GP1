List of Completed User Stories:
~1  As a user, when I click on the company logo, it takes me to the home page, no matter
which page I am on

~2 As a user, when I want to know Terms & Conditions, I click on it in footer, and
it takes me to it

~3  As a user, I want to have a good UX/UI experience and have fields be clear to me
that I need to enter input into

~4 As a user, I want to ensure my password is written correctly by having the opportunity
to enter it twice

Project Write-Up:  A fitness tracker that allows users to enter data (weight,
calories, activities, body type, etc.), to view, and to manipulate(edit or remove).
They can view their progress and results through graphical (charts, tables, etc.)
representation.

- Choose at least 2 user stories to work on.
- Prepare to Demo your sprint work for the class on Week 4 to end Sprint 1 and
	begin Sprint 2!

Deliverables to be submitted!
- Submit a link to your github repository with a brief summary of the work that
	was done by each developer, and a list of your user stories that are completed.

Example:
https:/github.com/<user>/myAD320Project
Team Member 1 - Worked on User Story X - Completed.
Team Member 2 - Worked on User Story Y - Still in progress, carrying over to next sprint
Team Member 3 - Worked on User Story Y with TM2, pair programming to speed up development.

This repository is for Group Project #1 in AD 320 - Web App Development at North
Group Project #1 - Requirements

For this project, you will work in groups of 4 to create a Web Application using
PHP and MySQL. Development will take place in an iterative, Agile style.

For week 2, we will start with a planning sprint for your project, where you will
decide what the project will be, create a backlog of user stories to develop, and
generate a UI Wireframe sketch of how your project will look.

The project must satisfy the following requirements:
- Serverside project code is PHP, exclusively. No python or JS
- Serverside Database is MySQL
- Project should include a way to perform all CRUD operations against a database,
For example, a book wishlist application that  
C: allows users to add book titles and ISBNs to a list,
R: allows users to view their list
U: allows users to edit a list entry
D: allows users to remove an entry from their list



The deliverables for Sprint 0 will be:
- Create a GitHub repository with all team mates added as collaborators. (Will
	demo in class)
- In your group repo's README.md file, include a brief write-up of your what your
	project will be.
- An image file that shows wireframes for all planned screens of your application
	(Simple sketches are fine)
- Create 10 user stories to be considered for development in Sprint 1 (Week 3)
	(Use GitHub Issues for this)

To submit, one person from the group should submit a link to the project github
repository to notify me that all the sprint 0 work has been completed. (Commits
to the repository for Sprint 0 work added after Wednesday 1/16 @ midnight will
be considered late work.)
